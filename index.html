         <h2>My Music Festivals</h2>
         <img class="left-padding" src="./images/lostlands.jpg">
         <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">My first music festival was Lost Lands 2018. I had never experienced something so beautfiul. Or with so many
            amazing people. They had two stages. Both HUGE and filled with dinosaurs. That was the moment my life changed. My second favorite festival was Spring Awakening. Unlike Lost Lands this festival is a day festival. The last festival I went to before the world shut down for a year was Wakaan. This festival was on top of
            Mulberry Mountain.</p>
         <h2>How To Style For Music Festival</h2>
         <img class="left-padding" src="./images/ravefits.jpg">
         <p>Its important to look and feel good when going to a festival. Festivals are an opportunity to explore different creative outfits and accessories. 
            I personally like to style myself in things that are comfortable and cute. One of my favorite shops is actually run by one of my best friends, <a class="nomadic" href="https://etsy.com/shop/ShopNomadicClothing">Nomadic Clothing</a> on Etsy. A couple of larger shops are FreedomRaveWear and iheartraves. </p>
